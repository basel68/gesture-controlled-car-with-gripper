# gesture-controlled-car-with-gripper
The "gesture-controlled-car-with-gripper" project seeks to create 
a highly functional robotic system comprising several key components that allow 
users to control a mobile robotic car equipped with a crane arm through intuitive 
hand gestures and precise joystick commands. This system leverages gesture 
sensing technology, wireless communication, and joystick control to perform tasks 
concurrently.
